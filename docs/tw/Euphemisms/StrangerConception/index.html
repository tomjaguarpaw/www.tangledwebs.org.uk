<div class="content"><h1>Stranger Conception</h1>
<h2>Donor-conception should be called Stranger Conception</h2>
<p>There is a service that is offered by medical practices throughout the world, public and private.  This service claims to be a "fertility treatment".  It is <strong>neither a treatment</strong>, <strong>nor</strong> does it <strong>improve anyone's fertility</strong>.  It is <strong>not</strong>, for that matter, <strong>a medical procedure</strong>.</p>
<p>The practice consists of taking a plastic tube of a man's semen &endash; the identity of this man being unknown to the woman &endash; and squirting that semen into the woman's uterus in an attempt to get her pregnant.  This procedure is performed on a woman whose male partner is infertile, or who has no male partner.</p>
<p>The name for this practice used to be <em>artificial insemination</em> and, to distinguish it from artificial insemination where the semen of the woman's husband was used, this was often clarified to <em>artificial insemination by donor</em> or <em>AID</em>.</p>
<p>The first two letters in the abbreviation were accurate: it was insemination and it was artificial.  However, "artificial" came to be seen as a pejorative, so the practice was rebranded <em>donor conception</em>.  This new term also encompasses in vitro fertilisation with what are called "donated" eggs.</p>
<p>The use of "donor" in these descriptions is highly misleading, as <a href="/tw/Euphemisms/#useoftermdonor">we noted elsewhere</a>.  It incorrectly suggests that the man "donating" has done something positive, selfless and beneficial to others.  What he is actually doing is abandoning his child.</p>
<p>We suggest that any conception in which the biological parents are strangers to each other or in which one or both intend to remain strangers to the child should be called <strong>stranger conception</strong>.  This description much more accurately reflects the reality of the situation.  A "sperm" "donor" should be called a <strong>stranger father</strong>, and an egg "donor" should be called a <strong>stranger mother</strong>.</p></div>
