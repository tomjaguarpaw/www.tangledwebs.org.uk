<div class="content"><h1>Against the National Gamete Donation Trust</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ngdt.co.uk/">National Gamete Donation Trust</a> (NGDT) is a UK organisation existing to encourage sperm and egg donation. I consider this highly irresponsible. In the eyes of many donor-conceived people their sperm or egg donor is their parent. These donor-conceived people feel that they have been abandoned. </p>
<p>Sperm and egg "donors" ask "Do I have any rights or responsibilities towards a child created from my donation?". <a href="http://www.ngdt.co.uk/rights-and-responsibilities/">NGDT</a> answers in the negative: "Not if you donate through an HFEA-licensed clinic, which must conform to strict medical, legal and ethical standards." </p>
<p>This is not the way many donor-conceived people feel. Although a "sperm donor" might be told he has no <em>legal</em> responsibilities to his children, they are still his children! He has an ethical obligation to be responsible for them. His children <em>want him</em> to be responsible for them. Giving away to someone else the power to create your children is hugely <em>irresponsible</em>. </p>
<p>A sperm bank says "You have no responsibility towards these children. They are not <em>your</em> children." The sperm bank is not in a position to decide who is a father. It is the donor-offspring themselves who are in a position to decide who is their father. Sperm donors are fathers. </p></div>
